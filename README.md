# Fine-Tuning-LLM-for-Math-Problems-with-LoRA-and-QLoRA

This project focuses on fine-tuning a **large language model (LLM)** to solve simple math problems. By using **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)** techniques such as **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** and **QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)**, the model can learn effectively while minimizing resource usage.

The **microsoft/orca-math-word-problems-200k** dataset from Hugging Face is used to train the model. The training process is optimized with **BitsAndBytes** for 4-bit double quantization, making it scalable even on smaller hardware setups.

## Workflow Overview  
1. **Load the Dataset**  
   - Use the `microsoft/orca-math-word-problems-200k` dataset from Hugging Face.  

2. **Quantization Setup**  
   - Configure **BitsAndBytes** to load the model in **4-bit double quantized mode** for efficient resource usage.  

3. **Tokenizer Setup**  
   - Set up and configure the tokenizer to handle math word problems.  

4. **Dataset Preprocessing**  
   - Format the dataset to prepare it for training, ensuring compatibility with the model's input format.  

5. **LoRA Configuration**  
   - Configure and initialize the **LoRA adapter** for efficient parameter tuning.  

6. **Training Setup**  
   - Define training arguments (e.g., learning rate, batch size) and create a `Trainer` instance for the training process.  

7. **Model Training**  
   - Train the model, tuning parameters to minimize training loss.  

8. **Merge Adapters**  
   - After training, merge the **LoRA adapter** with the base model to finalize the fine-tuned version.  

## Next Steps  
- **Upload to Hugging Face**: Once the training loss is optimized, the fine-tuned model will be uploaded to Hugging Face for public use.  
- **Deploy the Model**: The model will be deployed using **Streamlit** for interactive demos and **Amazon SageMaker** for scalable production environments.  

## Key Features  
- **Solving Math Problems**: A model fine-tuned for handling math word problems effectively.  
- **PEFT Techniques**: Efficient fine-tuning with LoRA and QLoRA to reduce computational requirements.  
- **Efficient Quantization**: Use of **BitsAndBytes** for 4-bit double quantization to make training faster and lighter.  
- **Reproducible Workflow**: Includes a step-by-step guide in a Colab notebook for experimentation and adaptation.  

## Model Access  
The fine-tuned model will soon be available on Hugging Face. Demos will be accessible via **Streamlit**, and the model will also be deployed using **Amazon SageMaker** for larger-scale applications.  

Stay tuned for updates!
